Hi Dan,

Thank you for your update and analysis. I understand the observations regarding the Dependency Agent installation and its transition to the ready state.

To further investigate and reproduce the issue, we can re-run the pipeline and monitor the VM during the process to gather more detailed insights. Let me know if there's any specific data or logs you'd like us to capture during this run.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed or if additional steps are required.

Thanks & Regards,
Revanth
