Hi Shanker,
I am following up as no one has reached out to me yet regarding the project allocation. Pathak asked about my current location, but there hasnâ€™t been any further communication.

Could you or any other hiring managers could assist? Being placed in a project is quite important for me at this stage.

Thank you!
