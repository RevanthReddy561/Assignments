Hi [Manager's Name],

Here is a summary of my work updates for the past week:

1. Summary of Work:

A new task was assigned regarding Azure Storage Mover, and I have started exploring its functionality and use cases.
Mike suggested testing the scenario in a lab environment. However, the lab environment needs to be created by Shamith, who is currently OOO.
Continued researching and gathering insights on Storage Mover to understand its capabilities and potential implementation better.
2. Challenges:

Unable to proceed with testing in the lab environment until it is set up.
Please let me know if you need further details or clarification.

Thanks & Regards,
Revanth
